•	Fans: Enhanced engagement through real-time data visualization.
•	Football teams: Optimized individual and team performance.
 
Game Concept: Speed & Distance Challenge
Tagline:
"Race to the top: Speed up, go far, and hit your targets!"
Game Overview:
Speed & Distance Challenge is a simulation game where players optimize their performance by focusing on speed and distance covered. Players maintain target speeds and achieve distance milestones during training sessions and matches to earn points. The goal is to reach a weekly target score, making gameplay engaging and data-driven.
 
Core Gameplay Mechanics
1.	Speed Monitoring:
o	Players earn points by reaching and maintaining a specific speed over a defined period, emphasizing consistency instead of just achieving a single speed target.
o	Consistency Points:
	Points increase with longer durations of consistent speed:
	Example: Maintain 7 km/h for 1 minute = 2 points; for 3 minutes = 6 points.
o	Speed Tiers:
	Tier 1 (Baseline Speed): 5–6.9 km/h = 1 point/min.
	Tier 2 (Optimal Speed): 7–8.9 km/h = 2 points/min.
	Tier 3 (High Speed): 9 km/h and above = 3 points/min.
o	Penalties for Fluctuations:
	If speed drops below the required range, no points are awarded for that interval.
	Bonus points for maintaining speed with minimal deviation (e.g., ±0.5 km/h from the target).
o	Dynamic Feedback:
	Real-time indicators display the player's current speed and consistency streak.
	Alerts notify players when their speed is inconsistent or falls below the target.
2.	Distance Covered:
o	Rewards for achieving specific milestones (e.g., 1 point per kilometre).
o	Track daily and weekly cumulative distances toward goals.
3.	Goal-Oriented Scoring:
o	Players must accumulate a set number of points (e.g., 50 points) by combining speed and distance metrics.
4.	Visual Feedback:
o	Real-time dashboards (e.g., heatmaps and bar charts) display speed trends and cumulative distance progress.
o	Alerts notify players when targets are exceeded or unmet.
 
Player Journey
1.	Training Phase:
o	Simulate training sessions to meet speed and distance targets.
o	Example: Cover 5 km at an average speed of 6.5 km/h to earn points.
2.	Match Day:
o	Compete in matches where total distance and average speed determine points.
o	Earn points for consistency and performance benchmarks.
3.	Weekly Target:
o	Accumulate the required points (e.g., 50 points) by the end of the week.
o	Failure results in actionable feedback for improvement.
 
Scoring System
1.	Speed Points:
o	1 point for every km/h sustained above a baseline (e.g., 5 km/h).
o	Bonus points for bursts of speed sustained over longer durations (e.g., 2 points for a 1-minute sprint).
2.	Distance Points:
o	1 point for every kilometre covered during a session or match.
 
Project Aims and Objectives
Aims:
•	Assess the impact of Fitbit on enhancing football players' speed and distance.
•	Examine how Fitbit data supports coaches in performance tracking.
Objectives:
•	Analyse player metrics like distance and speed.
•	Evaluate the effectiveness of Fitbit data for optimizing training and match performance.
 
Resources and Technologies
Resources Required:
•	Fitbit devices for tracking speed and distance.
•	Access to football training sessions and matches for data collection.
•	Survey tools for coaches, medical staff, and fans.
•	Statistical tools (e.g., Python, Excel).
Technologies:
•	Fitbit wearable devices for real-time data collection.
•	Data analysis tools (Python, Excel).
•	Visualization tools for heatmaps and dashboards (e.g., Tableau, Matplotlib).
 
Heatmap Integration: Tracking Player Progress
Heatmap Overview:
•	Visualize speed and distance metrics to track player progress.
•	Identify trends, high-performance periods, and areas of improvement.
Heatmap Design:
1.	Speed Heatmap:
o	Rows: Time intervals (e.g., hourly).
o	Columns: Days of the week.
o	Colours: Indicate average speed intensity (e.g., green for high speed).
2.	Distance Heatmap:
o	Rows: Days of the week.
o	Columns: Distance milestones.
o	Colours: Show cumulative distances achieved.
 
Conclusion
Summary:
•	Focus on speed and distance as the key performance metrics.
•	Quantify success through goal-oriented gameplay (e.g., reach X points in a week).
•	Provide actionable insights through Fitbit data integration.
Next Steps:
•	Develop the prototype with integrated heatmap and scoring systems.
•	Test and refine game mechanics for usability and engagement.
o	Test and refine game mechanics for engagement and usability.
